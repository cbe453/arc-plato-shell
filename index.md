The “shell” is the command-line interface of Linux and other UNIX operating
systems. In this three-hour hands-on workshop, you will learn how to connect to
a remote Linux system, use basic commands, navigate and work with files and
directories, use wildcards and pipes to build powerful commands, and write
simple shell scripts to automate your work. These basic skills will make you
autonomous with Linux and allow you to continue learning on your own. They are
also prerequisites for learning to use Linux high-performance computers.
