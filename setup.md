for Linux, MacOS or other UNIX systems; MobaXterm or PUTTY for Windows. We can
help attendees prepare their laptop on request.

### Windows

[http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net). You will want to
get the Home edition (Installer edition).

### macOS

Apple macOS comes with SSH pre-installed.

### Linux

Linux comes with SSH pre-installed.

## Campus wifi connection

Campus wifi users must be connected to the *uofs-secure* access point. Plato is
not accessible from *uofs-guest* or *uofs-public* on campus

See the following IT Knowledge Base article: [How do I connect to the
uofs-secure Wireless Network](https://wiki.usask.ca/x/cgDvXg).

## USask VPN

Remote users must be connected to the network through the USask VPN. Plato is
not accessible from outside the campus without the VPN.

## Notes

Attendees will be provided with an account on the Plato cluster, an HPC system
at USask. Accounts will be created after the list of participants is finalised,
and deleted once the workshop is over. Attendees who already use Plato will use
their existing account for the workshop.
